# üöÄ DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT - SIMPLIFIED INTERFACE
# ====================================================================
# Use these commands for your development environment:
#
#   make dev-setup   - Create complete dev environment (k3d + Dashboard)
#   make dev-reset    - Reset dev environment (clean rebuild)
#   make dev-nuke  - Destroy dev environment completely
#   make dev-access   - Access dashboard and services
#
# After 'make dev-setup', use 'make dev-access' for URLs and tokens
# ====================================================================

# Include shared functionality
include shared/helper.mk
include shared/python.mk
include shared/dev-env.mk

# Legacy includes (available but use simplified dev-env.mk instead)
include shared/k3d.mk
include shared/k8s.mk

# Project-specific configurations (override defaults if needed)
# SRC_DIR = src  # Already defaults to src in shared/python.mk
# CONDA_ENV_FILE = ./environments/development.yml  # Already defaults to this path

# Development environment is managed by shared/dev-env.mk (simplified interface)
# Use: dev-setup, dev-reset, dev-nuke, dev-access, dev-status
# 
# Legacy Kubernetes commands are still available in shared/k8s.mk, shared/k3d.mk
# But it's recommended to use the simplified dev-* commands above

# Add project-specific targets to .PHONY if any are defined
.PHONY: build run unit-test

# Development environment targets from shared/dev-env.mk
.PHONY: dev-setup dev-reset dev-nuke dev-access dev-cleanup app-build app-build-local app-install app-deploy app-redeploy app-uninstall
